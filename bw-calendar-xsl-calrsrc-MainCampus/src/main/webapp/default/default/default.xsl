    DEMONSTRATION CALENDAR STYLESHEET

    MainCampus Calendar Suite - Duke/Yale Skin

    This stylesheet is devoid of school branding.  It is a good
    starting point for development of a customized theme.

    It is based on work by Duke University and Yale University with
    credit also to the University of Chicago.

    For detailed instructions on how to work with the XSLT
    stylesheets included with this distribution, please see the
    Bedework Manual at http://www.jasig.org/bedework/documentation
