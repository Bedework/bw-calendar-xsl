<h2>The Bedework Administrative Client</h2>
<p>Select the tabs above to manage public events.</p>
<h3>Event Submitters</h3>
<p>If you are an event submitter, i.e you do not have approver access, you may create events that will await approval. Until they are approved you may update those events by locating them in the "Approval Queue" tab.</p>

<p>The "Manage Events" tab allows you to display events in
  your group(s), all events or to search for events matching
  specific criteria. As a non-approver you may only alter the status of these events. That is, you may cancel an instance, mark it as tentative or uncancel it</p>

<h3>Event Approvers</h3>
<p>If you are an event approver, you may approve submitted events. This action publishes the event and makes it visible on the public client.</p>

<p>You may add and update events for your own group(s). The "Manage Events" tab, by default, show events for your group(s).</p>

<h3>Updating Master Events</h3>
<p>Recurring events have a master event, which specifies rules
for creating instances of the event. There may also be overrides, which are modified instances.</p>

<p>If the master is modified, for example, the description is changed, overrides are NOT modified. Please be aware of this when making changes.</p>

<p>Changing the rule for a master can have severe consequences. If there are associated overrides these will be lost.</p>
